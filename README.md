# FFT-Visualizer
Music visualizer based of a set of 512 bands and FFT https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations/marketplace/15673416929/configure

You can also try this out without downloading the model here: https://www.roblox.com/games/14816177329/FFT

I’ve been working on this project for a while consisting of a audio spectrum which can be manipulated by a variety of factors such as windowing functions. I’ve experimented with loudness, RmsLevels, etc using AudioAnalyzer, AudioPlayer and Wire.
The visualizer uses Roblox's new audio classes that allow for more precise audio routing, which is useful for spatial audio, etc.
